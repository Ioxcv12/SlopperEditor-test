# SlopperEditor
SlopperEngine is a fully C# game engine, designed to be flexible and performant.
It supports 3D rendering, physics, basic 2D UI, serialization, and clean "scripting".
Planned features are a fully custom shading language, scalable multithreading, and builtin modding support.

This is the editor. For more information about the engine, check out https://github.com/capslock1/SlopperEngine
